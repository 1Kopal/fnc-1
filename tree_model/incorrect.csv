108,agree,discuss,"Jeh Johnson: Politicians Shouldn't 'Feed The Flames Of Fear' Over ISIS, Ebola","WASHINGTON -- Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson shot down claims on Thursday that a ""porous"" U.S. southern border is allowing terrorists, Ebola and a surge of unaccompanied minors into the country, despite claims to the contrary by some politicians.Johnson tried to dispel rumors and dial back fears during a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, saying there have been improvements to border security. He said the number of unaccompanied minors apprehended in fiscal year 2014 was 68,434 -- considerably lower than a projection of 90,000. Claims that four terrorists had crossed the border were false, he said, and the government is intensifying efforts to keep Ebola out of the U.S.But that's not always what people are hearing from politicians or reading in the news, he said.""Those of us in public office, and in the media –- whether in describing the border, ISIL or Ebola -- owe the public informed, careful, and responsible dialogue, not overheated rhetoric that is certain to feed the flames of fear, anxiety and suspicion,"" Johnson said. ISIL, the terrorist group that calls itself the Islamic State, also is called ISIS.Recent criticism of the Obama administration over border security has stoked fears over ISIS and Ebola, particularly by Republicans campaigning for November elections. Former Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.), now running for Senate in New Hampshire, said on Thursday that the border needed to be secured to prevent the spread of diseases into the country. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) said Tuesday that ""at least"" 10 members of the Islamic State were apprehended crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, a claim DHS said was false. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) has said that four men with ties to terrorism were apprehended along the border.Johnson said the four individuals were investigated and found to be members of the Kurdish Worker's Party, which he said ""is actually fighting against ISIL and defended Kurdish territory in Iraq."" The men remain in detention for unlawful entry, he said. (Chaffetz, for his part, continued to maintain after Johnson's speech that the men are terrorists, according to interview with CBS News.)On Ebola, Johnson said the government is ""heavily engaged"" and is ""enhancing our Ebola screening of air passengers from the three affected African countries, and we are continually evaluating whether more is appropriate.""""We very definitely in this country have the capability to deal with the Ebola virus,"" he said.Johnson touted border security improvements, but said DHS was still working to improve policies on transparency and internal agency coordination. One change in DHS policy, however, has been receiving considerable pushback from immigration advocates: the increased practice of holding families in detention. The government has expanded facilities for detaining families -- largely mothers with children, many of them seeking asylum -- over the past few months, and plans to add more space.Greg Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which has been critical of family detention, asked Johnson during a question and answer period after the speech why the government is expanding family detention when many of the women and children being held are seeking asylum and have fled horrific violence.Johnson said that given the increase this year in families crossing the border -- even though the numbers have dropped recently -- DHS needed to make sure it could detain them.""We believe it's necessary to build more of that capability in the event we have another spike like we had last summer,"" he said.Although Johnson acknowledged the influx of migrants over the past year was a ""setback,"" he said there have been improvements in border security, from more resources focused on patrol to fewer border-crossings.""In recent years, the total number of those who attempt to cross our southwest border has declined dramatically, while the percentage of those who are apprehended has gone up,"" he said. ""Put simply, it’s now much harder to cross our border and evade capture than it used to be -– and people know that."""
398,agree,discuss,Attorney: New audio reveals pause in gunfire when Michael Brown was shot,"(CNN) -- Could a newly released audio provide more clues on what led up to Michael Brown's shooting death?The FBI has questioned a man who says he recorded audio of gunfire at the time Brown was shot by Ferguson, Missouri, police on August 9, the man's attorney told CNN.In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four.""I was very concerned about that pause ... because it's not just the number of gunshots, it's how they're fired,"" the man's attorney, Lopa Blumenthal, told CNN's Don Lemon. ""And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.""The man, who asked that his identity not be revealed, lives near the site of the shooting and was close enough to have heard the gunshots, his attorney said.He was speaking to a friend on a video chat service and happened to be recording the conversation at the same time Brown was shot, Blumenthal said.The attorney said she learned of the man's recording late last week from a mutual friend.""I had to get his consent before I could reach out to the FBI,"" Blumenthal said.CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the tape and has asked the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the man who made the recording.The meaning of the pauseIt's difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports.Attorney Chris Chestnut said he was surprised by the gap in shots.""It's the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless -- he has no weapon,"" said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell.Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer.But if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the Brown incident, the pause doesn't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.""To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,"" said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire."" ""Maybe the officer will say, 'Well, I fired and he kept advancing, so I fired again.' ""Witnesses and a friend of Officer Darren Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led up to Brown's death.Dueling narratives in Michael Brown shootingDorian Johnson, a friend of Brown's who was walking with him at the time of the shooting, said the officer shot Brown once by the police car and again as he ran away.According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting.But a friend of Wilson said Brown mocked the officer and charged at him before the shooting began.An autopsy showed that all the entry wounds were in the front of Brown's body.Will autopsy shed any light on what happened?Key witness speaks outFerguson police said Brown allegedly robbed a convenience store shortly before the shooting.And reports that his friend Johnson had a criminal record that includes lying to police has put Johnson's credibility in question.In 2011, Johnson was arrested and accused of theft and lying to police about his first name, age and address.Johnson said Monday night he doesn't understand why some are questioning his credibility.""I see they bring up my past, my history, but it's not like it's a long rap sheet,"" Johnson told Lemon. ""This one incident shouldn't make me a bad person.""Michael Brown's funeral: Hope, tears and a call for social changeComplete coverageCNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Tina Burnside, Julian Cummings and Greg Botelho contributed to this report."

When she was a teenager, she started going by Paige Victoria Whitney and later underwent surgeries to become a woman.Taylor Lianne Chandler (Facebook Photo)Taylor Lianne Chandler (Facebook Photo)Chandler said she met Phelps, 29, on Tinder in August. He eventually invited her over to his place in Baltimore to watch a Ravens game in September and that’s when things went to another level.“One thing led to the next, and we made love during halftime,” she told Radar. “Later, we had sex again. The intimacy with him was amazing!

ISIS posted the extremely graphic video shot at an unknown location, titled 'A Message to America' to social media as proof of their barbaric actions.In a chilling warning at the end of grisly film, the executioner, who has what sounds like a British accent, paraded another American journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff, who went missing in August 2013, saying: 'The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.'The video emerged as President Barack Obama was returning from the White House to his Martha's Vineyard vacation. White House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden says the administration has seen the video. She says that if it’s deemed genuine by the intelligence community, the US would be ‘appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist.’His family issued a statement through their Free James Foley organization, which has been working to free the journalist.'We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.'As the disturbing video infolds, Foley, dressed in orange and on his knees, is unflinching to the end as he addresses the camera before his death. It appears the journalist has been coerced into blaming the United States by his brutal captors. His voice strong, but struggling at times to swallow as he battles against fear, he brands the US government his real killers as a man in black robes armed with a gun stands over him.Foley who has been missing for almost two years also leaves a haunting message for his brother, John, who is thought to be in the US Air Force. Referring to US airstrikes launched nearly two weeks ago in Iraq, Foley says: ‘I died that day, John, when your colleagues dropped that bomb on these people. They signed my death certificate’ As the appalling video unfolds, Foley blames the 'complacency and criminality' of the United States for his impending death.In his final, awful message to the world, Foley pleads for more time, to have seen his family who fought for his freedom for two years again. In a final insult from his vengeful executioners, Foley is made to deny his birthright as a citizen of the United States.'I wish I had more time, I wish I could have the hope of freedom and see my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t American,' says Foley before his tragic death.The reporter then stops speaking and his executioner steps forward. The masked, armed and black robe-clad man speaks in English in what is thought to be a British accent.Members of the UK's Associated Press pegged the accent to the South East of England and London, while others have claimed the accent resembles one from North Africa.‘This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country. As a government you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards the Islamic State,' begins the executioner.'You have plotted against us and gone far out of your way to find reasons to interfere in our affairs. Today, your military airforce is attacking us daily in Iraq. 'Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims. You are no longer fighting an insurgency. 'We are an Islamic Army and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide.

ISIS posted the extremely graphic video shot at an unknown location, titled 'A Message to America' to social media as proof of their barbaric actions.In a chilling warning at the end of grisly film, the executioner, who has what sounds like a British accent, paraded another American journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff, who went missing in August 2013, saying: 'The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.'The video emerged as President Barack Obama was returning from the White House to his Martha's Vineyard vacation. White House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden says the administration has seen the video. She says that if it’s deemed genuine by the intelligence community, the US would be ‘appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist.’His family issued a statement through their Free James Foley organization, which has been working to free the journalist.'We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.'As the disturbing video infolds, Foley, dressed in orange and on his knees, is unflinching to the end as he addresses the camera before his death. It appears the journalist has been coerced into blaming the United States by his brutal captors. His voice strong, but struggling at times to swallow as he battles against fear, he brands the US government his real killers as a man in black robes armed with a gun stands over him.Foley who has been missing for almost two years also leaves a haunting message for his brother, John, who is thought to be in the US Air Force. Referring to US airstrikes launched nearly two weeks ago in Iraq, Foley says: ‘I died that day, John, when your colleagues dropped that bomb on these people. They signed my death certificate’ As the appalling video unfolds, Foley blames the 'complacency and criminality' of the United States for his impending death.In his final, awful message to the world, Foley pleads for more time, to have seen his family who fought for his freedom for two years again. In a final insult from his vengeful executioners, Foley is made to deny his birthright as a citizen of the United States.'I wish I had more time, I wish I could have the hope of freedom and see my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t American,' says Foley before his tragic death.The reporter then stops speaking and his executioner steps forward. The masked, armed and black robe-clad man speaks in English in what is thought to be a British accent.Members of the UK's Associated Press pegged the accent to the South East of England and London, while others have claimed the accent resembles one from North Africa.‘This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country. As a government you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards the Islamic State,' begins the executioner.'You have plotted against us and gone far out of your way to find reasons to interfere in our affairs.

ISIS posted the extremely graphic video shot at an unknown location, titled 'A Message to America' to social media as proof of their barbaric actions.In a chilling warning at the end of grisly film, the executioner, who has what sounds like a British accent, paraded another American journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff, who went missing in August 2013, saying: 'The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.'The video emerged as President Barack Obama was returning from the White House to his Martha's Vineyard vacation. White House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden says the administration has seen the video. She says that if it’s deemed genuine by the intelligence community, the US would be ‘appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist.’His family issued a statement through their Free James Foley organization, which has been working to free the journalist.'We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.'As the disturbing video infolds, Foley, dressed in orange and on his knees, is unflinching to the end as he addresses the camera before his death. It appears the journalist has been coerced into blaming the United States by his brutal captors. His voice strong, but struggling at times to swallow as he battles against fear, he brands the US government his real killers as a man in black robes armed with a gun stands over him.Foley who has been missing for almost two years also leaves a haunting message for his brother, John, who is thought to be in the US Air Force. Referring to US airstrikes launched nearly two weeks ago in Iraq, Foley says: ‘I died that day, John, when your colleagues dropped that bomb on these people. They signed my death certificate’ As the appalling video unfolds, Foley blames the 'complacency and criminality' of the United States for his impending death.In his final, awful message to the world, Foley pleads for more time, to have seen his family who fought for his freedom for two years again. In a final insult from his vengeful executioners, Foley is made to deny his birthright as a citizen of the United States.'I wish I had more time, I wish I could have the hope of freedom and see my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn’t American,' says Foley before his tragic death.The reporter then stops speaking and his executioner steps forward. The masked, armed and black robe-clad man speaks in English in what is thought to be a British accent.Members of the UK's Associated Press pegged the accent to the South East of England and London, while others have claimed the accent resembles one from North Africa.‘This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country. As a government you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards the Islamic State,' begins the executioner.'You have plotted against us and gone far out of your way to find reasons to interfere in our affairs. Today, your military airforce is attacking us daily in Iraq. 'Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims. You are no longer fighting an insurgency. 'We are an Islamic Army and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide. 'So effectively, any aggression toward the Islamic State is aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic Caliphate as their leadership.'So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the Muslims their rights of living in safety under the Islamic Caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.’At this point the executioner beheads Foley, who is kneeling bravely with hands tied behind his back.

And in the Middle East, history may be repeating itself.  There have been reports:… that Islamic State militants in Mosul have contracted Ebola And:World Health Organization officials said they haven't confirmed the cases, but the organization has reached out to offer assistance. If there is disease, spreading in epidemic fashion in Mosul it may not necessarily be Ebola since:… Ebola symptoms — nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding and bruising — are also similar to those associated with a number of other diseases, including malaria, Lassa fever, yellow fever viruses and the Marburg virus. Also, most confirmed Ebola cases in this recent outbreak have originated in West Africa.Whatever the situation, ISIS will be pressed to deal with it since:Over the past few weeks, militants affiliated with ISIS have executed more than a dozen doctors in Mosul, according to Benjamin T.

Bedeh claimed the truce, which was widely welcomed, would lay the groundwork for the release of the more than 200 girls who were abducted in April, spurring the explosion of the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls.On Saturday, the supposedly appeased group launched an attack on a town in Adamawa State in eastern Nigeria, capturing 40 women and planting a flag in the town of Wagga. They also beheaded six victims during an assault on Friday, after the ceasefire deal was announced. All of which makes a truce, supposedly negotiated with the “chief of security” of the Boko Haram group and the Nigerian government, seem decidedly shaky.The ceasefire claims, and Boko Haram’s subsequent actions, have left people in Nigeria scratching their heads, with experts saying the ceasefire may have been a mirage, either a fraud concocted by the government or the middleman who brokered the agreement, whose real-life links to Boko Haram are now in dispute.Alleged Boko Haram envoy Danladi Ahmadu is now under scrutiny, with many questioning whether he is in fact the group’s chief of security and has the authority to speak on its behalf. During an interview on Friday, Ahmadu didn’t explicitly say that Boko Haram had agreed to a ceasefire, and he did not give details of the girls’ release, Arab News reports. Elders in Borno state in Nigeria’s north-east have publicly said that they believe the government was negotiating with a fraudster, and have yet to talk to the real Boko Haram.Boko Haram, meanwhile, has not released a public statement about the ceasefire. Rather, they have continued on a weekend campaign of violence, holding running battles with Nigerian security forces, who say that they have yet to receive any word from their superiors ordering them to cease fire in skirmished with the insurgents.“It is not clear who the said Boko Haram negotiator is, and whether he has the mandate of the entire group or just a faction of the entire group,” Arab News quoted Nnamdi Obasi, senior analyst of Nigeria for Crisis Group, an independent, nongovernmental organization.Some people think the announcement is a political move by President Jonathan to inspire optimism in voters and win their support, as it’s rumored he will announce his run for re-election in February 2015 over the next few weeks.

Rather, they have continued on a weekend campaign of violence, holding running battles with Nigerian security forces, who say that they have yet to receive any word from their superiors ordering them to cease fire in skirmished with the insurgents.“It is not clear who the said Boko Haram negotiator is, and whether he has the mandate of the entire group or just a faction of the entire group,” Arab News quoted Nnamdi Obasi, senior analyst of Nigeria for Crisis Group, an independent, nongovernmental organization.Some people think the announcement is a political move by President Jonathan to inspire optimism in voters and win their support, as it’s rumored he will announce his run for re-election in February 2015 over the next few weeks. The government said it has been working on negotiations with Boko Haram for months."

1293,unrelated,discuss,Isis Syria News: Iraqi Pilots 'Training Isis Fighters' to Fly Captured Planes,"ISIS claimed Friday that a 26-year-old female American hostage was killed in an airstrike in Syria, according to NBC News partners Flashpoint Intelligence.Defense officials told NBC News that U.S. military and military intelligence have no information to confirm ISIS' claim, and the State Department said it could not confirm reports of the death ""in any way.""""We are obviously deeply concerned by these reports. We have not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates ISIL's claim,"" said Bernadette Meehan, spokeswoman for the National Security Council said.Kayla Mueller, originally from Arizona, was taken hostage by ISIS in Syria on Aug. 4, 2013, while leaving a Spanish Doctors Without Borders hospital. Her family previously had requested Mueller's name not be made public for fear it would endanger her life.According to a statement released by a representative of her family on Friday urging caution in reporting on Mueller's situation, ""the common thread of Kayla's life has been her quiet leadership and strong desire to serve others.""""Kayla has devoted her career to helping those in need in countries around the world,"" the statement added.In a report distributed on Twitter, ISIS stated that Mueller was buried in the rubble of a building hit by Jordanian aircraft. Jordanian warplanes have pounded ISIS targets in Syria since the militants released a video that appeared to show a captured Jordanian fighter pilot being burned alive in a cage.Jordan disputed the ISIS claim.""ISIS is being illogical and they're lying,"" Mohammad Al Moumani, a spokesman for the information ministry, told NBC News. ""How do they know it's a Jordanian aircraft? What was a woman doing in their training center or weapons storage facility? Because those are what we're targeting.""State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said: ""I cannot confirm those reports in any way. Obviously people are looking into them, but cannot confirm them."" When asked if she knew if the hostage was alive, Harf said: ""We're just not going to get into specifics about Americans being held overseas.""One senior defense official told NBC News ""the entire intel community"" in the U.S. government ""lit up immediately at the ISIS claim and is attempting to gather the facts."" The official also said that if, in fact, the American woman has been killed it could be impossible to verify if was the result of an airstrike.Recently, President Barack Obama has said the U.S. is deploying ""all assets"" to save Mueller.Kayla Mueller in an undated family photo.Mueller's family previously had requested that her name not be made public, and little has been publicized about her ordeal.Her interest in activism started young: she was recognized as a National Young Leader while in high school at Tri City College Prep in Prescott, Arizona, and won several volunteering awards. As a teen, she volunteered for the Save Darfur Coalition, writing letters and placing calls to members of Congress, according to her local paper. Mueller also later wrote about Darfur while at Northern Arizona University, penning a piece in the school paper, The Lumberjack.After graduating from Northern Arizona University in 2009, Mueller worked with humanitarian aid organizations in India, Israel and Palestine, according to the statement issued on behalf of her family. It said she returned home to Arizona in 2011 and spent a year working at an HIV/AIDS clinic and a women's shelter before traveling to France to work as an au pair and study the French language.Sometime that year, Mueller uploaded a video to YouTube expressing solidarity with the Syrian people. While she initially studied French with the intention of working in Africa, according to the family representatives, Mueller instead went to the Turkish-Syrian border to work with Syrian refugees in December 2012.Mueller spoke of her experiences in Syria at her local Kiwanis club in May 2013, saying that she is often asked — once people learn she is American — ""where is the world"" by desperate refugees.""All I can do is cry with them, because I don't know,"" she said, according to an article on the event in her local paper. ""For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal. (I will not let this be) something we just accept.""She worked in Turkey with the Danish Refugee Council and the ""Support to Life"" humanitarian aid organization to assist refugees. When Mueller was taken captive in Aleppo, Syria, on Aug. 4, 2013, she was leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital.Kayla Mueller, left, with her mother Marsha Mueller in undated family photo.""Kayla found this work heartbreaking but compelling; she is extremely devoted to the people of Syria,"" her family said in the statement released Friday.ISIS first made contact with Mueller's family in May 2014 confirming the young woman was being held captive and providing proof of life, the statement added.ISIS demanded a $6.6 million ransom for her freedom, and/or the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist convicted of attempted murder by a New York federal court in 2010.Following the claims from ISIS about Mueller's death on Friday, former ISIS hostage Nicolas Henin posted on Twitter that ""Kayla Mueller was among the very last of my former cellmates still detained.""""I was full of hope she could have a way out,"" he added.— Kristen Welker and Andrea Mitchell contributed to this report"

1417,discuss,agree,"Tour, agent: Tiger Woods not banned","For the last few weeks, the general public has assumed that Tiger Woods hasn’t been playing on Tour because of his back and a dog shit golf game, but PGA Tour golfer, Dan Olsen — don’t worry, I haven’t heard of him before either —  is saying that’s simply not the case. Olsen went on record, during a radio interview with 730 WVFN’s David “Mad Dog” DeMarco, claiming his sources are telling him that Tiger Woods is currently serving a one month suspension for failing a drug test. Later in the interview, Olsen says his sources are “Tour players that are exempt.”Per Olsen’s interview with 730 WVFN:“I heard he’s on a month suspension. And it’s kind of a strong witness, a credible person that’s telling me this… It’s not testosterone, but it’s something else. I think when it is all said and done, he is going to surpass Lance Armstrong with…a…infamy.”Olsen didn’t stop at PED’s. He even goes as far as claiming Tiger Woods has allegedly been using questionable golf balls since the late 1990s. So questionable, in fact, that Nike has paid PGA Tour staff to pick up all the balls so no one get’s the balls.“Tiger, he’s got some problems now. One of the big problems, Nike’s been giving Tiger a ball that I would almost bet hasn’t been tested…Rory played it too. Remember when Rory signed the Nike deal and he played like an amateur for a year? He was going to fail out of the contract unless he got the high-spin ball too… So if you go to Tour events, Nike pays them, pays the Tour staff and the range staff, they pay them to get all those balls back. That’s why Tiger would never sign a golf ball and give it away… He played a ball that nobody else could play.”I have personally seen Rory McIlroy throw his golf balls into the stands, so I don’t know how valid this ball claim is. But, WOW. Dan Olsen must have very few fucks left to give if he’s publicly calling out Tiger Woods as a cheater on multiple levels.Thanks to BroBible writer and PGA Tour caddie, Pinot Pete, for getting this interview on our radar. And while Pinot Pete could not corroborate Olsen’s claim — nor would he probably want to, because LAWSUITS — he did say, “I’ve known Dan Olsen for 10 years. And in all that time, I’ve never known him to stretch the truth.” So there’s that."

We've shared some of th earlier rumblings about the Apple Watch's short battery life. Now we are hearing news of a new feature called Power Reserve, which could be a battery-saving mode that lets the Apple Watch run on low energy while only displaying the time.The Apple Watch's battery life is expected to only last a day. This puts it at the bottom of the pack for iOS smartwatches. Even with a Power Reserve function, the battery is significantly lagging behind the Pebble Time's seven day battery life. Even before wearables came on the scene, not everyone is diligent about plugging in their smartphones overnight. One of the most frustrating things in the world is a dead battery when you need to check your email, text, or actually make a call.If the expected battery life is only one day, then we must consider what happens with higher than average usage. Imagine if dynamic and draining apps are engaged, then the battery has the possibility of lasting only until midday. This means that the user will have to take his watch off to charge it.The allure of a wearable is its instant notifications while your phone is tucked away in your pocket. If the Apple Watch isn't on your wrist, will you be drawn to look at the notifications?Can the new consumers get used to plugging in every night? The Power Reserve feature sounds like it may revert the smartwatch back to an ordinary time piece to save battery life. It's still better than a running out of juice. Without a charge, a dead Apple Watch isn't even a watch. It's just an expensive bracelet. Perhaps the short battery life will be overshadowed by the army of apps and developers Apple has at its disposal. We'll let you know all the emerging details leading up to Apple's big event on March 9th, 2015.Source: The NY Times"

The man, who wished to remain unidentified, was recording a video chat with a friend when gunfire rang out in the background. Blumenthal said her client has already been interviewed by the FBI about the recording.On the tape, you can hear six shots being fired, a short pause and than an addition four or five shots. An autopsy report released last week said that Brown was shot at least six times.For more discussion on this, see justiceputnam's diary."

At first, locals believed the blast was caused by an earthquake, a regular occurrence in the country, Reuters said.“All the evidence that we’ve confirmed on-site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event,” said Jose Millan of the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies.The explosion on the outskirts of Managua, near the city’s airport, took place at around 11 p.m. and left a crater the size of a house.“It could have come off that asteroid because it is normal for that to occur. We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,” said Humberto Garcia, a Nicaraguan volcanologist.Calling it a “fascinating event,” Nicaragua’s first lady, Rosario Murillo, said the country would work with the U.S. Geological Service to find out more about what happened, The Daily Telegraph said."

1921,discuss,agree,"White House Fence-Jumper Overpowered Secret Service Officer, Ran Through Much of Main Floor","The man who jumped the White House fence this month and sprinted through the front door made it much farther into the building than previously known, overpowering one Secret Service officer and running through much of the main floor, according to three people familiar with the incident.An alarm box near the front entrance of the White House designed to alert guards to an intruder had been muted at what officers believed was a request of the usher’s office, said a Secret Service official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The officer posted inside the front door appeared to be delayed in learning that the intruder, Omar Gonzalez, was about to burst through. Officers are trained that, upon learning of an intruder on the grounds, often through the alarm boxes posted around the property, they must immediately lock the front door.After barreling past the guard immediately inside the door, Gonzalez, who was carrying a knife, dashed past the stairway leading a half-flight up to the first family’s living quarters. He then ran into the 80-foot-long East Room, an ornate space often used for receptions or presidential addresses.Gonzalez was tackled by a counter-assault agent at the far southern end of the East Room. The intruder reached the doorway to the Green Room, a parlor overlooking the South Lawn with artwork and antique furniture, according to three people familiar with the incident.Secret Service officials had earlier said he was quickly detained at the main entry. Agency spokesman Edwin Donovan said the office is not commenting due to an ongoing investigation of the incident.People jumping over the White House fence has become a more common occurrence, but most individuals are tackled by Secret Services officers guarding the complex before getting even a third of the way across the lawn. Gonzalez is the first person known to have jumped the fence and made it inside the executive mansion.Secret Service Director Julia Pierson has said the breach was “unacceptable” to her, and on Friday she briefed President Obama on her plans to shore up security.Pierson is expected to face tough questions about the Gonzalez incident Tuesday at a hearing by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The hearing is likely to cover a number of security lapses by the agency, including new revelations published over the weekend by The Washington Post about the failure to identify and properly investigate a 2011 shooting attack on the White House.The more detailed account of this month’s security breach comes from people who provided information about the incident to The Washington Post and whistleblowers who contacted Rep. Jason Chaffetz, (R-Utah), chairman of a House Oversight subcommittee on Homeland Security.Chaffetz said he plans to ask Pierson how an alarm meant to alert officers to intruders could be silenced or turned down. The congressman said two people inside the agency told him that boxes were silenced because the White House usher staff, whose office is near the front door, complained they were noisy. A Secret Service official told The Post that the usher’s office was concerned the boxes were frequently malfunctioning and unnecessarily sounding off.The alarm boxes, which officers call “crash boxes,” are key pieces of the agency’s first-alert system, according to former agents and officials. If they spot an intruder, officers are trained to hit the large red button on the nearest box — sending an alert to every post on the complex about the location of an incursion, and piping sound from that location to other boxes around the property.“If true, the fact that crash boxes were muted to avoid being ‘disruptive’ is not due to a lack of resources or an insufficient number of checkpoints or barriers,” Chaffetz said.He called the incident a “failure of leadership” by the Secret Service.“The agency needs a solution that goes deeper than more fences and more people,” Chaffetz said. “It must examine what message is being sent to the men and women who protect the president when their leader sacrifices security to appease superficial concerns of White House ushers.”The new revelations follow accounts provided to The Post last week detailing how Gonzalez’s ability to enter the White House reflected a failure of multiple levels of security around the compound. The agency relies on these successive layers as a fail-safe for protecting the president and the White House complex.In this incident, a plainclothes surveillance team was on duty that night outside the fence, meant to spot jumpers and give early warning before they made it over. When that team didn’t notice Gonzalez, there was an officer in a guard booth on the North Lawn. When that officer couldn’t reach Gonzales, there was supposed to be an attack dog, a specialized SWAT team and a guard at the front door — all at the ready.The dog was not released, a decision now under review. Some people familiar with the incident say the handler likely felt he could not release the dog because so many officers were in pursuit of Gonzalez, and the dog may have attacked them instead.Since the incident, the Secret Service has added an additional layer of temporary fencing while the agency reviews its procedures.Alice Crites contributed to this report.Related:Secret Service fumbled response after gunman hit White House in 2011Graphic: The night bullets hit the White HouseFence-jumper reveals security failures at White House"

The trove was attached to a big black parachute and, as the camera focused in on the shipment, it seemed for a moment abandoned. Then you see the masked man, who sermonized for the occasion. An American airdrop of arms, he said, which had been intended for Kurdish fighters defending the city of Kobane, had fallen into the hands of the Islamic State.“These are some of the American aid [items] that were dropped for the atheists in the” Kurdistan Workers’ Party,” the militant said in a video uploaded to jihadist social media accounts and initially reported by SITE Intelligence Group. “Ammunition, military equipment, additional equipment — these are some of the military weapons. The American forces dropped [them] … Praise be to Allah. Spoils for the mujahideen.”News of the accidental airdrop, which the Associated Press corroborated and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed, brought fresh criticism to a military tactic — the air drop — officials said has become substantially more accurate in the past few decades, but is still evidently prone to screw-ups. And those screw-ups have popped up several times so far in the battle against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, underscoring the dangers of trusting the winds to carry valuable resources to their targets.In early August, the U.S. military dropped more than 7,000 gallons of water and 36,000 packaged meals onto a barren mountain near Sinjar, the hiding spot for nearly 40,000 Yazidis who fled the Islamic State under threat of genocide. Many packages reached their intended targets — the Department of Defense estimated 80 percent — but not all of them did. “Iraqi officials said that much of the U.S. aid had been ‘useless’ because it was dropped from 15,000 feet without parachutes and exploded on impact,” wrote journalist Jonathan Krohn, who claimed to be the first Western journalist on the scene. The Washington Post’s Liz Sly agreed, saying the drops “apparently went awry.”Then NBC News reported late last month Iraqi military pilots accidentally dropped food, water and weapons to Islamic State fighters instead of to their own soldiers, who were battling to retain control of Anbar province. “Some pilots, instead of dropping these supplies over the area of the Iraqi army, threw it over an area that is controlled by ISIS fighters,” Hakim al-Zamili said, using another name for the Islamic State. “Those soldiers were in deadly need of these supplies, but because of the wrong plans of the commanders in the Iraqi army and lack of experience of the pilots, we in a way or another helped ISIS fighters to kill our soldiers.”Another general sheepishly added: “Yes, that’s what had happened.”The embarrassing anecdotes feed into the complicated history of the airdrop, which still carries risks despite being honed over decades with technological advancements such as GPS-guided parachutes. “There’s no way you can predict who may end up with those weapons, and who is going to use them, or how they are going to use them,” Greg Myre of the Middle East Institute told the Daily Sabah. “That is one of the risks you have to take.”It was a risk Bill Clinton was willing to take in 1993. That was the year he ordered an airdrop of tens of thousands of humanitarian packages over eastern Bosnia, despite the “military consistently arguing against involving U.S. troops in airdrops in hostile zones, given the fact that the accuracy of the drops is questionable,” the Associated Press then reported. The brass turned out to be right.One major problem laid bare during that mission, military scientists later said, was what they called “wind drift.” “The problem was identified in the late ’90s,” John McGinley, a scientist who researched the topic, told The Washington Post’s Holly Watt in 2008. “The terrain in Bosnia meant that instead of landing in one valley, the cargo could drift into another valley that was held by the enemy. Wind drift was causing all the problems.”So research teams got to work, ultimately unveiling wind-forecast software that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said increased the drop’s accuracy by 70 percent. “Inaccurate wind forecasts are the main culprit in missed targets for dropping supplies and other items from high altitudes,” the report said.It almost immediately went into use in the war in Afghanistan, where far-flung military outposts were separated by stretches of roads pockmarked with insurgents and explosives. There had to be another way to get soldiers the equipment they needed, military officials thought, so they launched a massive increase in airdrops. “We’ve gotten a lot more accurate over the years,” Air Force Gen. Arthur Lichte told USA Today.That may true. But following this week’s alleged delivery to the Islamic State, there’s clearly still room for work."

1974,unrelated,discuss,UPDATE: Internet report of Ebola outbreak in Purdon not true,"The World Health Organisation is investigating reports that ISIS militants have been showing up at an Iraqi hospital with Ebola.According to three media outlets an undisclosed number of militants displaying signs of the disease attended a hospital in the ISIS-held city of Mosul, 250 miles north of Baghdad.While the reports, from Kurdish and pro-Iraqi sources, remain unconfirmed, WHO spokesman Christy Feig said the group are trying to reach out to officials in ISIS-held areas to offer help.Infection: Several ISIS militants have arrived at a hospital in Mosul displaying signs of Ebola according to unconfirmed reportsUN workers are currently banned from entering ISIS-controlled areas in both Iraq and Syria so it is unlikely an operation in the region could be carried out.Ms Feig told Mashable: 'We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola.'The symptoms of ebola are similar to those of other diseases including malaria and yellow feverMosul has been under control of ISIS since June 2014 and over the past few weeks militants have reportedly executed more than a dozen doctors for refusing to treat injured fighters.According to a report in Iraq's pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, the disease was brought to Mosul by 'terrorists' arriving 'from several countries' and Africa.The symptoms of Ebola, which include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding and bruising, are similar to those of other diseases including malaria and yellow fever meaning it could easily have have been misdiagnosed.In addition, very few ISIS fighters are believed to have travelled up from West Africa where the Ebola outbreak originated with most coming from areas where there have been no reports of the disease.The reports have appeared in pro-government and Kurdish media but if true it could have catastrophic implications for people in ISIS-held areas as the group is against western science and medicine.It is not known if any of the surviving doctors in Mosul are equipped to test for Ebola or trained to treat patients and prevent the spread of the disease.ISIS fighters pictured in June 2014, when the extremist group swept through Iraq seizing territory including the city of MosulYesterday the United States and its allies staged 29 air strikes on Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq on Wednesday, the Combined Joint Task Force said.The action in Syria included 17 strikes near the cities of Al Raqqah, Dayr az Zawr and Kobani. A variety of Islamic State buildings, fighting positions and units were hit.In Iraq, 12 strikes targeted Islamic State buildings, fighting positions and units near the cities of Mosul, Fallujah and Sinjar.Fighters, bombs and remotely controlled aircraft were used."

2208,agree,discuss,Missing Libyan jetliners raise fears of terror attacks on 9/11,"Islamist militias in Libya took control of nearly a dozen commercial jetliners last month, and western intelligence agencies recently issued a warning that the jets could be used in terrorist attacks across North Africa.Intelligence reports of the stolen jetliners were distributed within the U.S. government over the past two weeks and included a warning that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack later this month on the date marking the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against New York and Washington, said U.S. officials familiar with the reports.“There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,” said one official. “We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.”The official said the aircraft are a serious counterterrorism concern because reports of terrorist control over the Libyan airliners come three weeks before the 13th anniversary of 9/11 attacks and the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi.Four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens, were killed in the Benghazi attack, which the Obama administration initially said was the result of a spontaneous demonstration against an anti-Muslim video.A senior State Department counterterrorism official declined to comment on reports of the stolen jetliners. A second State department official sought to downplay the reports. “We can’t confirm that,” he said.Meanwhile, officials said Egyptian military forces appear to be preparing to intervene in Libya to prevent the country from becoming a failed state run by terrorists, many with ties to al Qaeda.Libya remains an oil-rich state and if the country is taken over completely by Islamist extremists, U.S. counterterrorism officials believe it will become another terrorist safe haven in the region.The officials said U.S. intelligence agencies have not confirmed the aircraft theft following the takeover of Tripoli International Airport in late August, and are attempting to locate all aircraft owned by two Libyan state-owned airline companies, as security in the country continued to deteriorate amid fighting between Islamists and anti-Islamist militias.Video surfaced on Sunday showing armed fighters from the Islamist militia group Libyan Dawn partying inside a captured U.S. diplomatic compound in Tripoli. The footage showed one fighter diving into a pool from a second-story balcony at the facility.Tripoli airport and at least seven aircraft were reported damaged during fighting that began in July. Photos of the airport in the aftermath showed a number of damaged aircraft. The airport has been closed since mid-July.The state-owned Libyan Airlines fleet until this summer included 14 passenger and cargo jetliners, including seven Airbus 320s, one Airbus 330, two French ATR-42 turboprop aircraft, and four Bombardier CJR-900s. Libyan state-owned Afriqiyah Airways fleet is made up of 13 aircraft, including three Airbus 319s, seven Airbus 320s, two Airbus 330s, and one Airbus 340.The aircraft were reportedly taken in late August following the takeover of Tripoli International Airport, located about 20 miles south of the capital, by Libyan Dawn.Al Jazeera television reported in late August that western intelligence reports had warned of terror threats to the region from 11 stolen commercial jets.In response, Tunisia stopped flights from other Libyan airports at Tripoli, Sirte, and Misrata over concerns that jets from those airports could be on suicide missions.Egypt’s government also halted flights to and from Libya.Military forces in North Africa, including those from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Egypt have been placed on heightened alert as a result of intelligence warning of the stolen aircraft.Egyptian military jets reportedly have conducted strikes inside Libya against Libyan Dawn positions recently, and U.S. officials said there are signs a larger Egyptian military incursion is being planned.Egyptian President Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi was quoted as denying Egyptian air strikes into Libya have taken place but suggested that military action is being considered.Secretary of State John Kerry last week told his Egyptian counterpart that the United States would speed up the delivery of Apache attack helicopters, although it is not clear the Apaches would be used in any Libyan operations.Egypt’s military-backed government appears to be seeking a more significant role in regional security after the Obama administration helped engineer the ouster of Libyan strongman Moammar Qaddafi in 2011. Since then, the Obama  administration, through its announced policy of “leading from behind,” has stood by while Libya gradually has spiraled into chaos.The Libyan government announced Sunday that it no longer controlled the capital of Tripoli.“We announce that the majority of the ministries, institutions, and associations in the capital Tripoli are no longer under its control,” a government statement said.Libya’s parliament in August declared both Ansar al Sharia and Libyan Dawn as terrorist organizations working to overthrow the government.Ansar al Sharia, which is based in Benghazi, recently publicized on social media that it has obtained large numbers of more sophisticated weapons, including SA-6 surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft guns, rocket-propelled grenades, shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, assault rifles, and armored vehicles. The group is closely aligned with al Qaeda-linked rebels in Syria.Abderrahmane Mekkaoui, a Moroccan military expert, told Al Jazeera television, which first reported the airline theft Aug. 21, the alert regarding the stolen jetliners was preventive and covers the region from Cairo to Lagos Nigeria.Mekkaoui said the jets are being held by the Libyan group called Masked Men Brigade, which was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department in December.The Masked Men Brigade is linked to al Qaeda and Ansar al Sharia—the group behind the Benghazi terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2012.Until the Libya Dawn takeover of the airport, announced Aug. 24, two other militia groups, known as Al Qaqa and Al Sawa controlled the airport and all aircraft belonging to Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways.Mekkaoui said “credible intelligence” reports given to states in the region indicated the Masked Men Brigade “is plotting to use the planes in attacks on a Maghreb state” on the 9/11 anniversary.Counterterrorism expert Sebastian Gorka said that if the theft is confirmed, the stolen aircraft could be used in at least two ways.“The first would be how commercial airliners were used on Sept. 11, 2001, literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a super-high precision guided missile of immense potency,” said Gorka, who holds the Maj. Gen. Charles Horner chair at Marine Corps University in Quantico, Va.“The second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers,” he said.Michael Rubin, a counterterrorism specialist with the American Enterprise Institute, said commercial jetliners in the hands of terrorists could be formidable weapons.“Who needs ballistic missiles when you have passenger planes? Even empty, but loaded up with fuel they can be as devastating,” Rubin said.“Each plane could, if deployed by terrorists to maximum devastating effect, represent 1,000 civilian casualties.”Among the potential targets are urban areas and economic targets, like Saudi Arabia’s oil fields.“Anyone who has ever flown over Saudi Arabia at night can see refineries like Yanbu lit up like Christmas trees against the blackness of the desert,” Rubin said. “One Saudi security officer once told me that they would only have about 90 seconds to shoot down a hijacked plane from the time it left international airspace to impact in one of the region’s most important refineries.”Rubin said in 2003 a Boeing 727 went missing in Africa fueling concerns about a terror attack on the U.S. consulate in Karachi.“What is striking is that more than a decade later, the United States hasn’t taken the need to safeguard what are effectively giant guided missiles seriously,” he said.A former Libyan general, Khalifa Haftar, has been leading anti-Islamist forces. His group has access to Libyan air force MiG jets that have conducted strikes on Libyan Dawn positions in recent days. Haftar also has conducted military raids in Benghazi.The United Nations Security Council on Aug. 27 announced plans for new sanctions on Libyan militias and terrorists. In a resolution the U.N. warned of the “growing presence of al Qaeda-linked terrorist groups and individuals operating in Libya.”"

Since then, the Obama  administration, through its announced policy of “leading from behind,” has stood by while Libya gradually has spiraled into chaos.The Libyan government announced Sunday that it no longer controlled the capital of Tripoli.“We announce that the majority of the ministries, institutions, and associations in the capital Tripoli are no longer under its control,” a government statement said.Libya’s parliament in August declared both Ansar al Sharia and Libyan Dawn as terrorist organizations working to overthrow the government.Ansar al Sharia, which is based in Benghazi, recently publicized on social media that it has obtained large numbers of more sophisticated weapons, including SA-6 surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft guns, rocket-propelled grenades, shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, assault rifles, and armored vehicles. The group is closely aligned with al Qaeda-linked rebels in Syria.Abderrahmane Mekkaoui, a Moroccan military expert, told Al Jazeera television, which first reported the airline theft Aug. 21, the alert regarding the stolen jetliners was preventive and covers the region from Cairo to Lagos Nigeria.Mekkaoui said the jets are being held by the Libyan group called Masked Men Brigade, which was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department in December.The Masked Men Brigade is linked to al Qaeda and Ansar al Sharia—the group behind the Benghazi terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2012.Until the Libya Dawn takeover of the airport, announced Aug. 24, two other militia groups, known as Al Qaqa and Al Sawa controlled the airport and all aircraft belonging to Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways.Mekkaoui said “credible intelligence” reports given to states in the region indicated the Masked Men Brigade “is plotting to use the planes in attacks on a Maghreb state” on the 9/11 anniversary.Counterterrorism expert Sebastian Gorka said that if the theft is confirmed, the stolen aircraft could be used in at least two ways.“The first would be how commercial airliners were used on Sept. 11, 2001, literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a super-high precision guided missile of immense potency,” said Gorka, who holds the Maj. Gen. Charles Horner chair at Marine Corps University in Quantico, Va.“The second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers,” he said.Michael Rubin, a counterterrorism specialist with the American Enterprise Institute, said commercial jetliners in the hands of terrorists could be formidable weapons.“Who needs ballistic missiles when you have passenger planes? Even empty, but loaded up with fuel they can be as devastating,” Rubin said.“Each plane could, if deployed by terrorists to maximum devastating effect, represent 1,000 civilian casualties.”Among the potential targets are urban areas and economic targets, like Saudi Arabia’s oil fields.“Anyone who has ever flown over Saudi Arabia at night can see refineries like Yanbu lit up like Christmas trees against the blackness of the desert,” Rubin said. “One Saudi security officer once told me that they would only have about 90 seconds to shoot down a hijacked plane from the time it left international airspace to impact in one of the region’s most important refineries.”Rubin said in 2003 a Boeing 727 went missing in Africa fueling concerns about a terror attack on the U.S. consulate in Karachi.“What is striking is that more than a decade later, the United States hasn’t taken the need to safeguard what are effectively giant guided missiles seriously,” he said.A former Libyan general, Khalifa Haftar, has been leading anti-Islamist forces. His group has access to Libyan air force MiG jets that have conducted strikes on Libyan Dawn positions in recent days. Haftar also has conducted military raids in Benghazi.The United Nations Security Council on Aug. 27 announced plans for new sanctions on Libyan militias and terrorists. In a resolution the U.N. warned of the “growing presence of al Qaeda-linked terrorist groups and individuals operating in Libya.”"
2208,agree,discuss,11 aircraft are missing from ‘terrorist-held’ Tripoli airport ahead of 9/11 anniversary,"Islamist militias in Libya took control of nearly a dozen commercial jetliners last month, and western intelligence agencies recently issued a warning that the jets could be used in terrorist attacks across North Africa.Intelligence reports of the stolen jetliners were distributed within the U.S. government over the past two weeks and included a warning that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack later this month on the date marking the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against New York and Washington, said U.S. officials familiar with the reports.“There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,” said one official. “We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.”The official said the aircraft are a serious counterterrorism concern because reports of terrorist control over the Libyan airliners come three weeks before the 13th anniversary of 9/11 attacks and the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi.Four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens, were killed in the Benghazi attack, which the Obama administration initially said was the result of a spontaneous demonstration against an anti-Muslim video.A senior State Department counterterrorism official declined to comment on reports of the stolen jetliners. A second State department official sought to downplay the reports. “We can’t confirm that,” he said.Meanwhile, officials said Egyptian military forces appear to be preparing to intervene in Libya to prevent the country from becoming a failed state run by terrorists, many with ties to al Qaeda.Libya remains an oil-rich state and if the country is taken over completely by Islamist extremists, U.S. counterterrorism officials believe it will become another terrorist safe haven in the region.The officials said U.S. intelligence agencies have not confirmed the aircraft theft following the takeover of Tripoli International Airport in late August, and are attempting to locate all aircraft owned by two Libyan state-owned airline companies, as security in the country continued to deteriorate amid fighting between Islamists and anti-Islamist militias.Video surfaced on Sunday showing armed fighters from the Islamist militia group Libyan Dawn partying inside a captured U.S. diplomatic compound in Tripoli. The footage showed one fighter diving into a pool from a second-story balcony at the facility.Tripoli airport and at least seven aircraft were reported damaged during fighting that began in July.

The group is closely aligned with al Qaeda-linked rebels in Syria.Abderrahmane Mekkaoui, a Moroccan military expert, told Al Jazeera television, which first reported the airline theft Aug. 21, the alert regarding the stolen jetliners was preventive and covers the region from Cairo to Lagos Nigeria.Mekkaoui said the jets are being held by the Libyan group called Masked Men Brigade, which was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department in December.The Masked Men Brigade is linked to al Qaeda and Ansar al Sharia—the group behind the Benghazi terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2012.Until the Libya Dawn takeover of the airport, announced Aug. 24, two other militia groups, known as Al Qaqa and Al Sawa controlled the airport and all aircraft belonging to Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways.Mekkaoui said “credible intelligence” reports given to states in the region indicated the Masked Men Brigade “is plotting to use the planes in attacks on a Maghreb state” on the 9/11 anniversary.Counterterrorism expert Sebastian Gorka said that if the theft is confirmed, the stolen aircraft could be used in at least two ways.“The first would be how commercial airliners were used on Sept. 11, 2001, literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a super-high precision guided missile of immense potency,” said Gorka, who holds the Maj. Gen. Charles Horner chair at Marine Corps University in Quantico, Va.“The second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers,” he said.Michael Rubin, a counterterrorism specialist with the American Enterprise Institute, said commercial jetliners in the hands of terrorists could be formidable weapons.“Who needs ballistic missiles when you have passenger planes? Even empty, but loaded up with fuel they can be as devastating,” Rubin said.“Each plane could, if deployed by terrorists to maximum devastating effect, represent 1,000 civilian casualties.”Among the potential targets are urban areas and economic targets, like Saudi Arabia’s oil fields.“Anyone who has ever flown over Saudi Arabia at night can see refineries like Yanbu lit up like Christmas trees against the blackness of the desert,” Rubin said. “One Saudi security officer once told me that they would only have about 90 seconds to shoot down a hijacked plane from the time it left international airspace to impact in one of the region’s most important refineries.”Rubin said in 2003 a Boeing 727 went missing in Africa fueling concerns about a terror attack on the U.S. consulate in Karachi.“What is striking is that more than a decade later, the United States hasn’t taken the need to safeguard what are effectively giant guided missiles seriously,” he said.A former Libyan general, Khalifa Haftar, has been leading anti-Islamist forces. His group has access to Libyan air force MiG jets that have conducted strikes on Libyan Dawn positions in recent days. Haftar also has conducted military raids in Benghazi.The United Nations Security Council on Aug. 27 announced plans for new sanctions on Libyan militias and terrorists. In a resolution the U.N. warned of the “growing presence of al Qaeda-linked terrorist groups and individuals operating in Libya.”"

A second State department official sought to downplay the reports. “We can’t confirm that,” he said.Meanwhile, officials said Egyptian military forces appear to be preparing to intervene in Libya to prevent the country from becoming a failed state run by terrorists, many with ties to al Qaeda.Libya remains an oil-rich state and if the country is taken over completely by Islamist extremists, U.S. counterterrorism officials believe it will become another terrorist safe haven in the region.The officials said U.S. intelligence agencies have not confirmed the aircraft theft following the takeover of Tripoli International Airport in late August, and are attempting to locate all aircraft owned by two Libyan state-owned airline companies, as security in the country continued to deteriorate amid fighting between Islamists and anti-Islamist militias.Video surfaced on Sunday showing armed fighters from the Islamist militia group Libyan Dawn partying inside a captured U.S. diplomatic compound in Tripoli.

Charles Horner chair at Marine Corps University in Quantico, Va.“The second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers,” he said.Michael Rubin, a counterterrorism specialist with the American Enterprise Institute, said commercial jetliners in the hands of terrorists could be formidable weapons.“Who needs ballistic missiles when you have passenger planes? Even empty, but loaded up with fuel they can be as devastating,” Rubin said.“Each plane could, if deployed by terrorists to maximum devastating effect, represent 1,000 civilian casualties.”Among the potential targets are urban areas and economic targets, like Saudi Arabia’s oil fields.“Anyone who has ever flown over Saudi Arabia at night can see refineries like Yanbu lit up like Christmas trees against the blackness of the desert,” Rubin said. “One Saudi security officer once told me that they would only have about 90 seconds to shoot down a hijacked plane from the time it left international airspace to impact in one of the region’s most important refineries.”Rubin said in 2003 a Boeing 727 went missing in Africa fueling concerns about a terror attack on the U.S. consulate in Karachi.“What is striking is that more than a decade later, the United States hasn’t taken the need to safeguard what are effectively giant guided missiles seriously,” he said.A former Libyan general, Khalifa Haftar, has been leading anti-Islamist forces. His group has access to Libyan air force MiG jets that have conducted strikes on Libyan Dawn positions in recent days. Haftar also has conducted military raids in Benghazi.The United Nations Security Council on Aug. 27 announced plans for new sanctions on Libyan militias and terrorists. In a resolution the U.N. warned of the “growing presence of al Qaeda-linked terrorist groups and individuals operating in Libya.”"

2379,agree,unrelated,How did a Texas plumber's truck end up with Syrian rebels? (+video),"What happened when Texas City plumbers put a black pickup truck up for auction more than a year ago?This week, Mark Oberholtzer is among those trying to piece together the story. An Islamic extremist group in Syria was photographed opening fire off of the back of that very same F-250 truck — the company’s name and phone number printed on the side — and that image is now circulating around the Internet. A representative of Mr. Oberholtzer’s company, Mark-1 Plumbing Company, tells CBS News that the company lost track of the truck after selling it to an AutoNation dealership in Houston last year. Were members of the Ansar al-Deen Front – or their reps – operating in Texas buying used trucks? Or was there a more indirect path?Some observers have speculated that it must have taken many, many trades to get from the American South to the Middle East.But Andrew Collins, who oversees Jalopnik.com’s “Truck Yeah!” vertical, says the path from Texas to Syria may be shorter than some may think.“If he traded it in, he would have no idea where it’s going,” Mr. Collins says. “The highest bidder takes it, and they can do whatever they want.”The truck could have been put on a cargo ship bound for a Middle East car dealer within days. Car auctions, held several times each week, attract both used car dealers and exporters, he says.Exporters comprise a small minority of auction attendees and purchase cars that, generally, are in worse condition than the ones that American used car dealers buy, Collins says, who has also written about the auto industry for The Christian Science Monitor.Exporters then ship the cars overseas, where they are fixed up and resold.“The next person to buy it could have been the exporter who sold it to the militants,” says Collins, who himself bid in auto auctions for a car dealership for about a year. “I don’t know if ISIS has representatives in the car buying world — I don’t know anything about them. But [exporters] could have shipped it to Syria and sold it to the people who mounted weapons on it. It still would have been a few steps removed from the original seller, but I don’t think it had to be that complex.”An AutoNation manager would not comment on the vehicle’s sale history to CBS News.Oberholtzer tells the Galveston County Daily News that he received a thousand calls and faxes between Monday afternoon and Tuesday evening about the photo of his pickup truck.Oberholtzer’s son, Jeff, tells ABC News that he has received threatening phone calls from around the country.Call Mark-1 Plumbing for all your anti-aircraft needs: https://t.co/jVqhxvnij3— Shahed Amanullah (@shahed) December 17, 2014""To think something we would use to pull trailers now is being used for terror, it's crazy,"" Jeff Oberholtzer says.

Dictator fails to show for key Communist event (but does send a nice flower basket instead),"The North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has not been seen in public for more than a month, leading to rumors his sister has taken over while the Supreme Leader fights an illness or sits under house arrest.Where is Kim Jong Un?The saber-rattling North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month, spurring rumors he is ill and leading to speculation over who — if anyone — has filled the power vacuum in Pyongyang.But there's one atom bomb of a theory being mentioned by Korea watchers that's quickly gaining currency.Analysts believe 27-year-old Kim Yo Jong, the seventh and youngest of Kim Jong Il's children with four women, has risen rapidly within the regime and may be secretly running the Hermit Kingdom — for now.Little Kim reportedly went to the same Swiss boarding school with Kim Jong Un and has held positions within the North Korean government since her father was in power.""If in fact she is running the country — as someone in their early- to mid-20s — to me that is quite alarming,"" Center for Strategic and International Studies analyst Victor Cha told CNN. ""It means there is something seriously wrong with Kim Jong Un and there is some sort of void that they're desperately trying to fill.""State TV showed Kim Jong Un uncharacteristically walking with a noticeable limp in July at the 20th anniversary memorial commemorating the death of his grandfather, the nation's founder.After the Supreme Leader's recent vanishing act, health theories have abounded. Kim is ill with everything from gout and a cheese addiction to ankle problems and diabetes. State media called what ails Kim ""discomfort"" in a Sept. 26 report.He may even be under house arrest, according to Remco Breuker, professor of Korean studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands.""We're not sure where he is, or what's happening,"" Breuker told the ABC News. ""We don't know whether he's in the hospital or whether he's been put under house arrest.""Kim Jong Un, whose pal Dennis Rodman said is 31, saw his waistline balloon since he ascended to power in late 2011, analysts note.Sis Kim Yo Jong is a senior official in the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. But her role might have expanded dramatically if Kim Jong Un is incapacitated.""She is one of the only people in (North Korea) that we know has unfettered direct access to KJU. At the present time I would not be surprised if she is sole gatekeeper,"" North Korea Leadership Watch blog's Michael Madden told NBC News.Korea watchers point to Friday's anniversary of the founding of the Ruling Workers Party. If Kim Jong Un doesn't show, expect speculation to reach fever pitch.jmolinet@nydailynews.com Follow on Twitter @jmolinetON A MOBILE DEVICE? CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO."
